# Glowy Wallpapers — Project Roadmap

## Executive Summary

**Glowy Wallpapers** is a cross-platform mobile wallpaper app built with Flutter for Android and iOS. Users browse high-quality wallpapers organized by categories — static images, looping videos, and thematic classifications — download them to their device, save favorites, and preview wallpapers in a phone frame mockup before setting them.

The app follows a freemium monetization model: free users see AdMob ads (banner on home, rewarded ads gating downloads and previews, and an app-open ad on launch), while premium subscribers via native in-app purchases (Google Play Billing on Android, StoreKit on iOS) enjoy a fully ad-free experience. Firebase Cloud Messaging powers push notifications to drive engagement and re-engagement.

## Phase 1 — Foundation & Scaffolding

> Set up the Flutter project, Clean Architecture folders, core infrastructure, and native splash. The app compiles and navigates from splash to an empty Home shell.

| #    | Task                 | Description                                                                                 |
| ---- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.1  | Project Creation     | Create Flutter project, install all packages, configure min SDK versions                    |
| 1.2  | Folder Structure     | Scaffold the full feature-first Clean Architecture tree (10 features × 3 layers)            |
| 1.3  | Error Handling       | `Failure` base class + `ServerFailure`, `CacheFailure`, `NetworkFailure`; custom exceptions |
| 1.4  | Environment Config   | Envied setup for dev/staging/prod with API keys, AdMob IDs, Stripe keys                     |
| 1.5  | Dependency Injection | Injectable + GetIt wiring; `@module` for Dio, SharedPrefs, Hive, SecureStorage              |
| 1.6  | Network Layer        | Dio client factory, auth interceptor (token attachment), PrettyDioLogger (dev only)         |
| 1.7  | Theme & Styling      | Material 3 light/dark `ThemeData`, `AppColors`, `AppTextStyles` with Google Fonts           |
| 1.8  | Router Skeleton      | GoRouter with all placeholder routes, named route constants, initial → `/splash`            |
| 1.9  | Core Widgets         | `AppCachedImage`, `AppLoading`, `AppErrorWidget`, `AdaptiveGrid` (responsive columns)       |
| 1.10 | Native Splash        | `flutter_native_splash` config with branding; SplashPage initialization placeholder         |
| 1.11 | Main Entry Point     | Wire bindings → Hive → DI → Firebase → AdMob → `MaterialApp.router`                         |

**Exit Criteria:** App compiles on both platforms, shows native splash, navigates to empty Home screen.

| 2.4 | Auth Interceptor          | Auto-attach `Authorization: Bearer` header; handle 401 → clear session → redirect to login                                      |
| 2.5 | Router Auth Guard         | GoRouter `redirect`: unauthenticated → `/login`; authenticated + on login → `/home`                                             |
| 2.6 | User Profile              | ProfilePage showing name, user ID, subscription badge; unsubscribe button (placeholder, wired in Phase 5)                       |
| 2.7 | Splash Subscription Check | Check login → call `/subscription/status` → store premium flag → show ad flag if free → navigate                                |
| 2.8 | Global Subscription Cubit | App-wide `SubscriptionCubit` (`free` / `premium`) provided at root; updated on check, purchase, cancel                          |

**Exit Criteria:** Users can register, log in, view profile. Protected routes redirect. Premium status checked on every cold start.

## Phase 5 — Monetization (AdMob & In-App Purchases)

> Integrate all ad formats and the native in-app subscription flow via Google Play Billing (Android) and StoreKit (iOS). Free users see ads; premium subscribers enjoy an ad-free experience. Cancel reverts to free.

| #   | Task                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |

| 5.6 | IAP Data Layer           | `in_app_purchase` plugin integration; `IAPDataSource` listens to `InAppPurchase.instance.purchaseStream`; verify receipts server-side (`POST /subscription/verify`); Hive-cache premium flag |
| 5.7 | Purchase Flow            | `InAppPurchase.instance.buyNonConsumable` (or subscription product) → handle `PurchaseStatus.purchased` → verify → update `SubscriptionCubit` to premium; error + pending states |
| 5.8 | Restore Purchases        | `InAppPurchase.instance.restorePurchases()` → re-verify each restored transaction → reactivate premium; surface result via `SubscriptionCubit`                                |
| 5.9 | Get Premium Page         | Feature comparison table (Free vs Premium), price fetched from `ProductDetails`, "Subscribe Now" button → IAP flow, "Restore Purchase" button                                |
| 5.10 | Cancel / Manage Flow     | Profile page: direct user to Play Store / App Store subscription management via `url_launcher` (platform-specific deep link); no in-app cancel — managed by platform          |

**Exit Criteria:** Banner ad on Home, rewarded ads gate downloads/previews, app open ad on launch. Google Play / App Store purchase flow works end-to-end. Receipt verified server-side. Premium removes all ads. Restore purchases reactivates premium on reinstall.

## Implementation Order

```
Phase 1  ──►  Phase 2  ──►  Phase 3  ──►  Phase 4  ──►  Phase 5  ──►  Phase 6
Foundation    Auth &        Home &        Detail,       AdMob &       Firebase,
& Scaffold    Profile       Categories    Downloads     IAP           Polish &
                                          & Favorites   Premium       Store
```

Each phase builds on the previous one. Do not skip phases — later features depend on infrastructure established in earlier ones.
